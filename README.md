# A demo illustrating the drawing of various shapes in drawRect #

This is just a small project I set up to demonstrate something for stack overflow. Note I might delete this repository anytime.
The project was created with Xcode 8.0 and is written in Swift 3.

On a *completely unrelated* note, here's a joke:
